For a price to be efficient, it should be the case that a buyer and seller are not prevented from making a trade that they would both agree to under a different price. For example, if the price is set too low, there will exist some suppliers who would be willing to sell only at a higher price and some buyers whose need for the good is so great that they would be willing to buy at that higher price. Similarly, if the price is set too high, there will exist some suppliers who would be happy to sell at a lower price to the buyers whose need for the good is not high enough to match the higher price.

Consider that there are tens of millions of goods in the US.
