It is shocking and comforting to me that there isn't large scale strategic terrorism. There are people in this world who really believe that Exxon is destroying the potential for human civilization on this planet, or that Monsanto is poisoning everybody, or that election officials in Georgia helped steal the election for Biden. Why the law of large numbers does not turn these beliefs into repeated episodes of violence and destruction is very mysterious to me.

Much of the pessimism about the future comes from the belief that as destruction becomes cheaper and easier, there will be a level of ubiquitous violence from disaffected, hateful, and nihilistic people which will make civilization untenable. But this argument misses that our world is relatively peaceful despite it already being cheap and easy to inflict mass casualty:

> As a means of killing civilians, suicide terrorism is a tactic of diabolical ingenuity. It combines the ultimate in surgical weapon delivery—the precision manipulators and locomotors called hands and feet, controlled by the human eyes and brain—with the ultimate in stealth—a person who looks just like millions of other people. In technological sophistication, no battle robot comes close. The advantages are not just theoretical. Though suicide terrorism accounts for a minority of terrorist attacks, it is responsible for a majority of the casualties. This bang for the buck can be irresistible to the leaders of a terrorist movement. As one Palestinian official explained, a successful mission requires only “a willing young man . . . nails, gunpowder, a light switch and a short cable, mercury (readily obtainable from thermometers), acetone.... The most expensive item is transportation to an Israeli town.” The only real technological hurdle is the willingness of the young man.

You could explain the lack of terrorism by the fact that terrorism has historically [not been effective](https://www.gwern.net/Terrorism-is-not-Effective). But this is begging the question. The fact that most terrorists have been nonstrategic does not explain why they have been so nonstrategic. In fact, it becomes even more mysterious that people who are willing to give their lives for Jihad or some other cause are not particularly invested in maximizing the destructive potential of their attacks. Though even this is not as perplexing as the fact that most political and philosophical movements don't utilize violence - effective or ineffective - in the first place.

There is no reason to think that terrorism cannot be strategically effective. It is absolutely possible to cripple a huge multinational corporation, by bombing a board meeting, assassinating important middle management, or randomly killing employees until no one wants to work for that company (or ideally a combination of all of these). There are people in this world who really think that destroying a particular company would be an unequivocally good thing. Again, the belief that Exxon is destroying the world is not that uncommon. How can the consequences of saving the world be outweighed by the deaths of a few innocent people (although not that innocent - after all, they're helping destroy the world)? And yet, Exxon's CEO has not been assassinated and its headquarters have not been bombed.

Nor is it possible to explain the lack of huge terrorist attacks by claiming that the kind of person who becomes a terrorist is likely to be incompetent. Plenty of intelligent and capable people throughout history have believed in wacky ideas.

And it is also false to claim that people don't believe in these causes enough to devote their lives to them. To become an environmental lawyer, you have to give hundreds of thousands of dollars of tuition and four years of your time (not to mention that you have to accept a lifetime of depressed wages). People will expend this kind of effort in order to metaphorically fight Exxon. It's not more effort (and possibly less effort) to literally fight Exxon.

Terrorism can work, and there are lots of people out there who presumably want it to work for a cause they believe in. **The only possible explanation I can come up with for the shocking lack of large scale strategic terrorism is that people's imaginations are severely constrained by the tactics people around them use**. If the normal and socially accepted way to fight Monsanto is to become an activist, lobby your legislators to make it necessary to label GMO products, and publish documentaries about how bad GMOs are, then that's what people will do in order to fight Monsanto. They will not consider bombing Monsanto seed plants until the company looses its manufacturing capacity, or repeatedly assassinating the top management until no one is willing to take over.

**This kind of strategic violence may be more effective than "raising awareness", and may even be justified given a person's priors. And yet mysteriously, it is rarely considered, much less employed, by the devotees of most causes.**

In the next post, I will talk about why this propensity to imitate often causes us to ignore the best strategies to achieve our goals.
