In my last post, I talked about how the lack of large scale strategic terrorism in our society tells us that people's considerations of the methods by which they can achieve their goals are severely constrained by how other people achieve those same goals. In this essay, I will explain why this memetic faculty leads us to chase the lowest probability paths to success.

**The basic insight is that you split your probability of success with those you are fungible with, and this turns promising paths of success into improbable ones as more people follow them**.

In cases where success is non-rivalrous, where someone's else achievement does not diminish your likelihood of getting that same achievement, this principle does not apply. But in a world of limited resources and unlimited wants, competition is usually the name of the game.

This principle is most evident in business. If there were no Indian restaurants in either San Francisco (pop. 883,000) or San Angelo (pop. 100,000 and my hometown), you should move to San Francisco and start one there. But given that there are 100+ Indian restaurants in San Francisco and 0 in San Angelo, and that Indian restaurants are in direct competition with each other, you have much better odds of success in San Angelo than San Francisco. In San Angelo, your restaurant is fungible with nothing, whereas in San Francisco, a version of your food is served on every block. This principle applies in more places than you would expect.

Consider, for example, that your goal is to make the next great contribution to computer science theory. If there was no one else in the world who wanted to achieve the same goal, you would have the highest odds of success by getting a PhD from a good school and doing research with the scientists there working on open problems. But every person who is trying to make the next big discovery in the subject is doing the same exact thing - learning the same frameworks from the same textbooks in the same sequence in order to solve the same problems that everyone else is competing to solve. Again, it could well be the case that socially, this is the best way to train researchers, because the conventional problems are the most important and the conventional frameworks are the most promising. Yet as an individual researcher, you would be fungible with (and thus in competition with) everyone else who is also applying the same approach.

Let's say that the conventional approach

Now it could still be the case that the probability of success is so much higher inside the system than outside that splitting the odds with the people following the conventional path still leaves you better off that trying something weird. But I suspect that we overestimate the cases where this is true in order to justify our instinct to imitate.

This is not to mention that humans achieve satisfaction in life largely by knowing that without their efforts, things would have turned out differently, which is the literal negation of what it means to be fungible.
