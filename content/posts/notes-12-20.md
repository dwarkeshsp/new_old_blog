# Notes

## 12/20/20

- If writing for Substack becomes a viable business model, it's only a matter of time before investors become willing to seed young writers in order to reap a percentage of their blog revenues.

## 12/19/20

- This blog would be worth regularly writing if every post would get on average 100 reads. I'm going to remember that if I surpass that number and feel unmotivated.

## 12/17/20

- When I ask intellectuals why it is good to gain insights from their field and convey them to others, I get mediocre hand-wavy answers. One economist told me, "What else would I do?", as if he chose his life's work the same way someone chooses to watch Netflix in their free time. I suspect this is because it is low status to explain why your work matters - if you're high status, people should already know why.

- There is much less violence of all kinds - terrorism, crime, suicide - than an examination of people's incentives would predict.

# Excerpts

## 12/18/20

> Those men on the line were my family, my home. They were closer to me than I can say, closer than any friends had been or ever would be. They had never let me down, and I couldn’t do it to them.... I had to be with them, rather than let them die and me live with the knowledge that I might have saved them. Men, I now knew, do not fight for flag or country, for the Marine Corps or glory or any other abstraction. They fight for one another.

> William Manchester

Contra Yuval Noah Harari. Soldiers usually die for friends and family, not for abstractions and stories.

> "Speculators raise prices today but lower prices in the future. As a result, speculators have an image problem because the media often report when speculators raise prices but rarely do they report when speculators lower
> prices. Overall, however, society is better off from speculation because speculators move oil from when it has low value (today) and move it to when it has high value (the future)."

Speculators make society antifragile

> "To be blunt, I deny the value of almost all of the social science research going on at top schools.  My reaction to 95% of the articles published in top economics journals isn’t so much “That’s wrong!” as “So what?” ... Call me a megalomaniac, but in my heart of hearts I deem dozens of my blog posts to be more valuable intellectual contributions than the typical article published in top social science journals."

It still astonishes me that people work so hard and for so long in order to answer less important questions in places where they will reach fewer people.

> "The fact that no given individual or set of individuals controls or coordinates all the innumerable economic activities in a market economy does not mean that these things just happen randomly or chaotically. Each consumer, producer, retailer, landlord, or worker makes individual transactions with other individuals on whatever terms they can mutually agree on. Prices convey those terms, not just to the particular individuals immediately involved but throughout the whole economic system—and indeed, throughout the world. If someone else somewhere else has a better product or a lower price for the same product or service, that fact gets conveyed and acted upon through prices, without any elected official or planning commission having to issue orders to consumers or producers—indeed, faster than any planners could assemble the information on which to base their orders."

> Thomas Sowell, Basic Economics

> "However overwhelming it might be for a government agency to try to keep track of 24 million prices, a country with more than a hundred million people can far more easily keep track of those prices individually, because no given individual or enterprise has to keep track of more than the relatively few prices that are relevant to their own decision-making. The over-all coordination of these innumerable isolated decisions takes place through the effect of supply and demand on prices and the effect of prices on the behavior of consumers and producers. Money talks—and people listen. Their reactions are usually faster than central planners could get their reports together."

> "So let us consider a counterfactual history in which Szilard invents nuclear fission and realizes that a nuclear bomb could be made with a piece of glass, a metal object, and a battery arranged in a particular configuration. What happens next? Szilard becomes gravely concerned. He sees that his discovery must be kept secret at all costs. But how?"

As a civil libertarian opposed to Bostrom's scheme of global ever-present surveillance, I don't have a better answer to this question that hope we innovate ways to make the detonation of nuclear bombs very hard. We had a COVID vaccine within a weekend, after all.
